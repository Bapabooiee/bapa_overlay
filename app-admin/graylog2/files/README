This README won't be installed when you merge this package, but is included
in this overlay for those who aren't using Gentoo, but want to make use of 
the init script anyway. 

The script will be maintained in this overlay from now on, instead of 
a separate Git repository.

And now:

---

First off, you're gonna need Graylog2 installed. If you don't already have it,
go to http://www.graylog2.org/download/ and download/extract graylog2-server.

Once you've done so, go into the "dist" directory, and copy the file "graylog2-server.jar" 
and the "lib" directory into /usr/local/share/graylog2 (create the directory if it doesn't exist).

Then, copy the files:
	`graylog2.initd' to /etc/init.d/graylog2
	`graylog2.confd' to /etc/conf.d/graylog2

The file/dir layout should look like this afterwards:
	/etc/init.d/graylog2
	/etc/conf.d/graylog2
	/usr/local/share/graylog2/graylog-server.jar
	/usr/local/share/graylog2/lib/json-simple-X.X.jar
	/usr/local/share/graylog2/lib/mongo-X.X.jar
	/usr/local/share/graylog2/lib/syslog4j-X.X.XX.jar

Note: You can edit a variable in /etc/conf.d/graylog2 to point to where Graylog2 is installed.

If everything went well, you should be able to start Graylog2 just like any other system service:
	$ sudo /etc/init.d/graylog2 start

You're going to need Java and MongoDB installed to use Graylog2.
